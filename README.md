# Fetal Oxygenation Study (FOX): Differential gene expression analysis of maternal blood from preterm pregnancies with and without preeclampsia

This site contains the analysis of RNA-seq data from maternal blood collected into PAXgene tubes from women who gave birth preterm. Gene expression differences were investigated between women who had preeclampsia during their pregnancies, and those who had no hypertension.

Details of the analysis can be found [here][].
