# Fetal Oxygenation Study (FOX): Transcriptome analysis of maternal blood from preterm pregnancies

This site contains the analysis of RNA-seq data from maternal blood collected into PAXgene tubes from women who gave birth prior to 34 weeks (preterm) to growth restricted neonates (cases), and women who gave birth to appropriate for gestational age neonates at term (controls). Gene expression differences were investigated between cases and controls. Gene expression differences were also investigated in the case cohort alone, between women who had preeclampsia during their pregnancies, and those who had no hypertension.

Details of both analyses can be found [here][].

A [workflowr][] project.
