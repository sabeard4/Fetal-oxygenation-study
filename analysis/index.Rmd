## Transcriptomic analysis of circulating RNA from the maternal blood of women with preterm growth restricted pregnancies

This site contains the analysis of RNA-seq data generated from maternal blood collected into PAXgene tubes. Blood was collected from women prior to delivery for preterm fetal growth restriction. Gene expression differences in the maternal blood between women with and without preeclampsia were identified using two methods limma-voom and REVSeq-edgeR. Both methods yielded the same result. Follow the links below to explore different aspects of the analysis.
